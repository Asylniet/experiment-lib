Welcome to Exparo testing library!

# Getting Started

The repository is monorepo with the following structure:

```
apps/
 |__ admin/
 |__ backend/
 |__ web/
packages/
 |__ library/
```

## Admin panel

The admin panel is a React application that allows you to manage your experiments and users.

### Running locally

To run the admin panel locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev --filter=admin
```

This will start the admin panel on http://localhost:5174. You can login with the credentials from the `.env` file: ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD.

Also you can test hosted admin panel on https://exparo.assylniet.kz

---

## Backend

The backend is a Django application that provides the API for the admin panel.

### Running locally

To run the backend locally:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the backend on http://localhost:8000.

---

## Web application

The web application is a React application that allows you to test your experiments.

### Running locally

To run the web application locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev --filter=web
```

Although it's recommended to run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start all applications and run build for library in watch mode. That is slightly faster than building library on every change

Also you can test hosted demo website on https://exparo-demo.assylniet.kz

---

## Library

The library is a React library that allows you to use experiments in your application.

### Running locally

You can't exactly run the library locally. Since it is a package, it can't be run directly. Use the web application to test it.

### Usage

To use the library read the documentation in the [docs](https://github.com/asylniet/experiment-lib/tree/main/packages/library/DOCS.md).

# Deployment

To deploy the application you need Docker and Docker Compose.

1. Change the .env file to your needs. ALLOWED_HOSTS is the hosts you want to use.
2. If you want to configure SSL certificates:
    1. Run `chmod +x ./init-letsencrypt.sh`
    2. Run `./init-letsencrypt.sh -e <email> -d <domain1> -d <domain2> -d <domain3>...`
   3. Change the ./nginx/conf.d/${your-domain}.conf files to your needs.

Run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the applications.
